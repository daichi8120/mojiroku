"""Score speaker order and attribution around turn changes (Issue #65).

Compares the app's speaker-labelled transcript segments against the exact turns
written by make_dialogue.py.

Metrics
- straddling segments: segments that cover two or more reference turns by at
  least MIN_OVERLAP each, i.e. one line holding "A's tail + B's reply".
- mislabelled time: share of reference speech whose segment carries the wrong
  speaker. Predicted ids are mapped one-to-one to reference speakers (the
  assignment with the largest total overlap); extra predicted ids stay distinct
  and count as wrong, so one person split into several ids is not "perfect".
- turn order: edit distance between the reference speaker sequence and the
  predicted one, after merging consecutive same-speaker lines, divided by the
  reference length (0 = same order).
- short replies: reference turns under 1.2 s that got their own line with the
  right speaker.
- text recall: share of reference characters found, in order, in the output
  (punctuation and spaces ignored).

Usage:
    python3 eval/diarization/turns/score.py out/ja.json out/ja.pred.json [...]
    (pairs of reference and prediction files)
