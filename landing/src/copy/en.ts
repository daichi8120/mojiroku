// ── mojiroku landing copy (English) ──
// Not a literal translation of ja.ts — rewritten as native US-market SaaS copy
// (short headlines, active voice, privacy-first framing), while keeping the same
// house rules: shipped features only, cloud sending is strictly opt-in, no
// competitor is named. The shape must match `Copy` (= typeof ja); tsc enforces it.
// NOTE: mentions English transcription/summaries — ship this page together with
// (or after) the app release that includes English language support.
